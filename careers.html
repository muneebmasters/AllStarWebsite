        <p> <!--start of my overview of what software engineers do-->
            When most people think about the field software engineering, they dont tend to think
            about the major components of vehicles, cell phones, TVs and just about any other
            major electronic device out there. Software engineers, one way or another, probably
            had some impact in all of these innovations. The computer chips in the vehicles
            we drive that control the engine and even braking and accelerating were designed
            by hardware engineeers and programmed by software engineers. The computer and cell phone operating systems that keep
            a computer running smoothly and tell it how to open and close programs and allocate
            resources are made by software engineers. Some types of positions in this field include the
            following

        <p>
            Software engineers can go from sitting in an office and working on a large program to going
            to a racecar company and helping to design an advanced simulator for them.
            There are not many fields today that do not require the help
            of a computer and hence, a computer or software engineer
