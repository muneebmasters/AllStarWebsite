                        This field of computer engineering is the personality aspect of the computer whereas
                        hardware engineering is the body aspect. Software engineers design programs
                        and interfaces that millions of people use in everything ranging from cell phones,
                        simulators, and even microwaves. These programs and interfaces work hand in hand
                        with the hardware to provide easy access to information. For example, the device
                        you are reading this on right now is using some sort of operating system, which
                        a software engineer developed. This operating system that you are
                        using also most likely has a program such as a browser which it is using to display
                        this website. Once again this browser or program was programmed by a software programmer.</p>
                    <p>
                        One of the biggest and most most effective examples to display the effectiveness
                        of a software engineer was the original iPhone. Yes, the hardware
                        aspect of the system contributed to the attractiveness of this device,
                        but even more effective in luring in customers is the user interface and operating
                        system that this device implements called iOS. This operating system allows
                        for the smooth transistion in and out of Apps, the smooth movement when navigating,
                        and the look and feel when using the device. Software engineers were
                        involved in the development of this OS and the Apps too!</p>
