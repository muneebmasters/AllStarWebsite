                        Problems in programming are very exciting and challenging. Overcoming these challenges
                        is fun for me and many programmers out there.

                        Taking an idea and bringing it to life through programming is one of the most exciting aspects
                        of Computer Science for me. Many other fields require lots of hardware, physical tools, physical locations, etc...
                        in order to create something but in CS, all you need is a computer and an internet connection. Plus, most tools
                        that programmers need are FREE or Open Source!

                    <p>
                        Programming is very logical and before programming, most people's lives are not very straightforward
                        but programming is extremely straightforward. Therefore, it introduces a new way to rationalize about problems
                        and think things through logically. This could help people rationalize important decisions outside of programming such
                        as picking which college to go to or which major to choose.

                        Most of the cool technologies used today wouldn't be possible without computers and programming such as 
                        Uber, snapchat, PlayStation, self-driving cars, advanced medical care, etc....
