            IBM stands for International Business Machines and is one of the worlds largest
            compaies for manufacturing and selling both software and hardware for computers.
            The company has its headquarters in Armonk, New York. The average salary at IBM
            for software engineers is at around $60000-$80000. The average

            The company has gained some fame recently. Besides creating extremely recognized
            processors, the company has recently tried to show the world what their processors
            and software can do by competing on a gameshow. But they did not just compete man
            vs. man, they put man vs. machine on the famous show Jeopardy. IBM placed one of
            their newest innovations called Watson, an artificial AI that can think and respond
            to questions, against the champs of the game show. Watson won to the surprise of
            the contestants. Watson is just one example of the many innovations that IBM has performed and will most likely perform over
            the next few years Some other and more basic products and services the company 
            currently offers are:

            Yes you've probably drank Red Bull but that is not the whole Red Bull experience.
            From BMX to rally racing and F1 formula racing, Red Bull doesnt quit at the
            just the energy drink. The company needs some of the best software engineers to
            compete in the racing world of Formula 1. Red Bull has one of the most advanced racing simulators.
            This simulator calculates hundreds, if not thousands of calculations
            a second and computer programmers or engineers are required to design such programs
            so that the drivers have a chance to learn the tracks without visiting the actual track
