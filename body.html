            Hello, My name is Muneeb Alvi and I am a recent Master's graduate of the University of Pittsburgh.
            I am looking for great opportunities to learn and teach computer science concepts
        </p>

        <p>
            I live around the Pittsburgh area and have been living here for about the
            last 20 years or so. Iâ€™ve moved around quite a few in this area, and I discovered a lot more about Pittsburgh
            and its people by moving from one part to another. There is a lot more to Pittsburgh than most people would believe
        </p>
        
        <p>
            In my free time I like to program in new languages and learn new technologies. I also enjoy playing video games and spending time with friends and family.
        </p>
